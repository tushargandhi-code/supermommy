          We use data from TheSuperMommy app and other TheSuperMommy Company Products, as well as
          from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers, and other sponsored content that we
          believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as possible
          to you.

          Research and innovation – We use the information we have to study our Service and
          collaborate with others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the
          well-being of our community.

          Ensuring a stable global infrastructure for our Service – To provide our global Service,
          we must store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including outside of
          your country of residence. Try your luck with This infrastructure may or may not be owned
          or operated by TheSuperMommy Developers Pvt. Ltd. or their affiliates.

          Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community.
          Organizing and analyzing information for our growing community is central to our Service.
          A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us
          personalize, protect, and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad
          global community. Technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning give us
          the power to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help
          us ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service.

          Offering personalized opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover, and share.
          We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences you actually care
          about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about,
          and use that information to help you create, find, join, and share in experiences that
          matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers, and accounts you
          might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience TheSuperMommy, based on
          things you and others do on and off TheSuperMommy.

          Fostering a positive, inclusive, and safe environment – We develop and use tools and offer
          resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and
          inclusive, including when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems
          that work to combat abuse and violations of our Terms and policies, as well as harmful and
          deceptive behavior. We use all the information we have-including your information-to try
          to keep our platform secure. We also may share information about misuse or harmful content
          with other Companies or law enforcement.

          is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of your content
          that you post on or through the Service. Instead, when you share, post, or upload content
          that is covered by intellectual property rights (like photos or videos) on or in
          connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free,
          transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run,
          copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works of your content
          (consistent with your privacy and application settings). You can end this license anytime
          by deleting your content or account. However, content will continue to appear if you
          shared it with others and they have not deleted it.

          Permission to use your username, profile picture, and information about your relationships

          relationships (such as follows) next to or in connection with accounts, ads, offers, and
          other sponsored content that you follow or engage with that are displayed on TheSuperMommy
          Products, without any compensation to you. For example, we may show that you liked a
          sponsored post created by a brand that has paid us to display its ads on TheSuperMommy. As
          with actions on other content and followers of other accounts, actions on sponsored
          content and followers of sponsored accounts can be seen only by people who have permission
          to see that content or follow.

        <p>You agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on your device.</p>
        <p>
          If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we
          believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone’s
          intellectual property or impersonates another user).
        </p>
        <p>
          If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available
          in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide that you add to
          content you create or share), we retain all rights to our content (but not yours).
        </p>
        <p>
          You can only use our intellectual property and trademarks or similar marks only with our
          prior written permission.
        </p>
        <p>
          You must obtain written permission from us or under an open source license to modify,
          create derivative works of, decompile, or otherwise attempt to extract source code from
          us.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can remove any content or information you share on the Service if we believe that it
          violates these Terms of Use or we are permitted or required to do so by law. We can refuse
          to provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or
          disabling your account) immediately to protect our community or services, or if you create
          risk or legal exposure for us, if you repeatedly infringe other people’s intellectual
          property rights, or where we are permitted or required to do so by law. If we take action
          to disable or terminate your account, we will notify you where appropriate. If you believe
          your account has been terminated in error, or you want to disable or permanently delete
          your account, then you can contact us.

        <p>
          Content you delete may persist for a limited period of time in backup copies and will
          still be visible where others have shared it. This paragraph, and the section below called
          “Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree,” will still apply even after your account
          is terminated or deleted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your use of content on the Service is also subject to our guidelines, and your use of our
          API is subject to our Platform Policy. If you use certain other features or related
          services, additional terms will be made available and will also become a part of our
          agreement. If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in
          effect.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If we fail
          to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver. And we reserve all
          rights not expressly granted to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          This agreement does not give rights to any third parties. You cannot transfer your rights
          or obligations under this agreement without our consent. Our rights and obligations can be
          assigned to others. For example, this could occur if our ownership changes (as in a
          merger, acquisition, or sale of assets) or by law.
        </p>
        <p>
          We always appreciate feedback or other suggestions, but may use them without any
          restrictions or obligation to compensate you for them, and are under no obligation to keep
          them confidential.

          We also don’t control what people and others do or say, and we aren’t responsible for
          their (or your) actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or content (including
          unlawful or objectionable content). We also aren’t responsible for services and features
          offered by other people or companies, even if you access them through our Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our responsibility for anything that happens on the Service (also called “liability”) is
          limited as much as the law will allow. If there is an issue with our Service, we can’t
          know what all the possible impacts might be. You agree that we won’t be responsible
          (“liable”) for any lost profits, revenues, information, or data, or consequential,
          special, indirect, exemplary, punitive, or incidental damages arising out of or related to
          these Terms, even if we know they are possible. This includes when we delete your content,
          information, or account.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are a consumer, the laws of the country in which you reside will apply to any
          claim, cause of action, or dispute you have against us that arises out of or relates to
          these Terms (“claim”), and you may resolve your claim in any competent court in that
          country that has jurisdiction over the claim. In all other cases, you agree that the claim
          must be resolved exclusively in the Indian district Court for the New Delhi, that you
          submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of
          litigating any such claim, and that the laws of theIndia will govern these Terms and any
          claim, without regard to conflict of law provisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may change our Terms of Use, Service and policies, and we may need to make changes to
          these. And if you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms.
